# Port Scanner in GO

I'm still working on this, but the title already said everything.

# How to use it 
You can use this script with the following command : 

main.go 
        -h [ip adresse]
        -p [specific port]
        -f [All the 65000 ports, otherwise it'll scan the first 1024]

I recommand you to build it first with the command: 
go build main.go
It'll be faster this way when you'll use it
